# BenKasperProjects
My name is Benjamin Kasper, and I am pursuing a bachelor's degree in data science at the University of Pittsburgh. Throughout my 4 years at this school, I have gained valuable programming experience in Java, Python, and R. In this repository, I have uploaded several of my most prominent projects that I have worked on in this repository. Any questions/comments can be directed to ben.kasper.0714@gmail.com

## R Projects
### Goalie Clutchness
This R project analyzes NHL shot data to profile goalies and prototype a “clutch score.” It loads a dataset with every shot taken in 2024 (Gotten from Moneypuck.com), excludes playoff games, and builds basic context such as games played per goalie, shots on goal per game, and total shots faced. For the clutch metric, it filters to regulation shots on goal that were not goals and weights each save by situation: a score‐state multiplier (0→3.0, 1→2.5, 2→1.8, 3→1.2, ≥4→1.0) and a time multiplier that grows with game time (exp(0.05 * minutes), capped with a large bump at ≥60 mins), then multiplies those by the shot’s xGoal value to produce a per-shot clutch contribution. It then ranks the total clutch score by goalie, lists the top 50 clutch saves, and reports averages per shot and per game (with sensible volume filters). I’m still actively tuning the exact numbers for the clutch score, so treat current values as a working heuristic that I’ll calibrate further against additional seasons and validation checks.

## Java Projects
### Crossword Creator
This project is a Java-based crossword puzzle solver that uses recursive backtracking and dictionary lookups to automatically fill a crossword board. The program supports placing fixed letters, open slots (+), blocked spaces (-), and even number-based constraints that limit how many times a letter may appear, though the - and numeric constraints are still a work in progress. As it fills the board, the solver checks each row and column in real time against a dictionary to ensure that every sequence is either a valid word or a valid prefix. The project demonstrates recursive algorithms, constraint satisfaction, and efficient string handling with StringBuilder to track progress as the puzzle is solved.

### Airline Management System
This project is a Java-based airline route management system that models cities and flights as a weighted graph. It loads a dataset of cities and routes, storing both the distance and ticket cost for each connection. Once built, the system can retrieve all direct routes from a given city, compute itineraries with the fewest stops using breadth-first search, and find shortest-distance or cheapest paths between cities using Dijkstra’s algorithm. It also supports itineraries with mandatory transit cities and can generate all trips that stay under a given budget. Internally, it uses a directed graph representation with adjacency lists, custom DirectedEdge and Route classes, and standard graph algorithms for traversal and optimization. While core pathfinding works, features like generating minimum spanning trees are placeholders for future development. This project highlights graph data structures, shortest-path algorithms, and practical applications in travel and transportation systems
